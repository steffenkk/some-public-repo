    "# Tutorial 1: Setting up your AWS Account\n",
    "\n",
    "Aloha challenge participant ü§ô We are glad to welcome you to the fifth Global Data Science Challenge (GDSC). This year is all about [fighting river blindness](https://www.capgemini.com/code-for-a-cure/#:~:text=Launching%20in%20early%202022%2C%20'Code,neglected%20tropical%20diseases%2C%20River%20Blindness). On this journey, we will be using a few different machine learning techniques and algorithms as well as the AWS cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è. This very first tutorial is about helping you setting up your AWS account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with this tutorial, there is a [video](TODO: add link to video) which walks you through the steps performed here. The video is optional for you. In this notebook tutorial the command line interface (CLI) is used for the majority of the tasks.  In the video, we mainly use the AWS Web Interface (also called AWS Console) to achieve the same. This is sometimes a bit easier, especially if you don't have a tech background. Feel free to choose whichever you prefer. \n",

    "\n",
    "During the challenge, we will be working in [Sagemaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/). This service provides a managed jupyter lab environment in which we can execute our notebooks. To use Sagemaker Studio we need to create a sagemaker domain and add a user to this domain (one per team is sufficient). After we did this, we will download the notebooks to the freshly created jupyter lab. In order to execute the notebooks, there are plenty dependencies and libraries we need to have installed. To simplify this for you, we will use a custom Docker image created in advance. We will just need to attach this image to your sagemaker studio domain and you can use it afterwards as a kernel in juypter lab.\n",

    "TLDR; In this section of the tutorial, we will:\n",

    "- Create a new sagemaker user in that domain,\n",
    "- Attach the custom docker image to the domain, \n",
    "- Download the notebooks to sagemaker, and\n",
    "- Start a new notebook with the kernel from our custom docker image. \n",
